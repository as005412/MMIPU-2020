Problems which I was faced:
My biggest problem was: out of memory
My system on virtual machine had not enough memory, I thied to increased it, but nothing succeeded, so I have no options left but to reinstall the system with much more memory.
There were other problems, but they were not so difficult and were fixed instantly.
